 <h1> We are the local community that runs free and cheap classes for people in the community to learn skills such as cooking, pottery and languages.
 We have volunteers from all over the world to teach you . We have started this community since 1997 and we have got more and more classes every year.
 All of our classes are held in A.B.C. building. You can have an online class if you are not free on that day.
